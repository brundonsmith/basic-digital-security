# What is this?

My uncle emailed me a few months ago. Someone had broken into his email account,
and he was asking for advice on how to keep his digital life more secure going 
forward.

I'm a garden-variety software engineer, not a security researcher, but I
believe there are certain basic practices of "security hygeine" that everyone 
should be following but that many less-technical people may not even know about.
So this web page is my attempt to create a simple, accessible, one-stop source
for those practices which people can send to friends or relatives who may need
it.

# Goals

The inforamtion here is meant to cover a very specific set of use-cases:

1. It should only be information that *everyone* can and should implement in 
their digital lives. We don't need to get into Tor, or setting up a home VPN,
or isntalling a hardened Linux distro. Keep it simple.

2. It should be expressed in plain, concise English that your (non-technical) 
grandparents can understand and follow. The most important thing is to simply 
describe what should be done; a nice-to-have is an expression of the reason it's
important, if that can be put in plain English; and we shouldn't bother at all
with the technical details, even if some subset of visitors might be able to 
follow them. Practical advice only; we don't want to lose people's attention.

# Contributing

Pull requests are welcome for:

- Corrections to incorrect information or bad advice
- Improvements to wording that make something more easily understandable and/or 
more concise
- New points that you feel should be included

Note that in the third case above, new points will need to meet a very high 
level of importance to be incorporated. Remember, the goal is for this to be
narrow, focused, and practical. If something isn't both simple and of high
importance, it may not be worth adding, even if it's otherwise good advice.
