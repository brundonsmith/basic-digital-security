    <h1>Keeping your computers secure</h1>

    <p>
      There are a few basic things that every person with a computer, or phone, or 
      email account, should be doing to keep their digital lives secure from those 
      who would try and do them harm. This web page is a collection of these best
      practices, in plain English that any regular person can understand and follow.
    </p>

    <p>
      I recommend following this checklist yourself, and then passing it on to others!

    <h2 id="online-accounts">Online Accounts</h2>

    <h3 id="passwords">Create good passwords</h3>

    <p>
      Avoid using things like real words and birthdays in your passwords. Even 
      if you think they're sufficiently unpredictable, computers can guess 
      passwords by the millions per second. Your best bet is to use a totally 
      random group of letters/numbers, and to not reuse it anywhere else. If 
      passwords from one website leak, hackers will try to use those passwords 
      on other sites. If you've used the same one somewhere else, that account
      is in danger.
    </p>

    <h3 id="two-factor">Set up two-factor authentication</h3>
    
    <p>
      Set up "two-factor authentication" wherever it's offered on your online 
      accounts. This will send a text message with a secret code to your phone 
      whenever you try to log in from a new device, requiring you to enter it 
      to sign in. This adds an extra layer of security, because a hacker would
      need to access both your password *and* your text messages to get in.
    </p>

    <h3 id="email">Protect your email account most of all</h3>
    
    <p>
      Your email account is a sort of "skeleton key" for all of your other 
      accounts, since it can be used to rest your passwords. So the above two 
      points are especially important for your email account.
    </p>

    <h2 id="computers-and-phones">Computers and phones</h2>

    <h3 id="system-up-to-date">Keep your operating system up to date</h3>

    <p>
      Whether on Windows, a Mac, an iPhone, a Samsung phone, an iPad, or anything 
      else, it's important to keep your operating system up to date at all times. All 
      of these systems should support automatic updates; in most cases, automatic 
      updates will be turned on for you by default. If they aren't, and you see a 
      prompt asking if you want to update, always say yes.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you're on Windows but don't have Windows 10, this update won't happen 
      automatically because it isn't free. But it's important that you perform it.
      If you **are** on Windows 10, your Start Menu will look something like this:
    </p>

    <img src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnotebooks.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2015%2F08%2FWindows-10-Start-Menu.jpg&f=1&nofb=1">

    <p>
      Windows 7 and older have stopped receiving security updates. That means that 
      if a vulnerability is discovered that allows hackers into those Windows systems,
      it will not be fixed by Microsoft. This makes it a very bad idea to continue
      using these systems.
    </p>

    <h3 id="secure-browser">Use a secure web browser</h3>

    <p>
      Your web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari) is the program you use to 
      browse the internet. There are lots of nasty things on the internet, and one
      of the easiest and most important steps you can take to protect yourself from
      them is to use a secure web browser.
    </p>

    <p>
      These days, browser security is pretty good. The only really important browser
      *not* to use is Internet Explorer. It comes preinstalled on many Windows 
      computers. Its icon looks something like this:
    </p>

    <img src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fupload.wikimedia.org%2Fwikipedia%2Fcommons%2Fthumb%2F1%2F1b%2FInternet_Explorer_9_icon.svg%2F1024px-Internet_Explorer_9_icon.svg.png&f=1&nofb=1">

    <p>
      Internet Explorer is an old and poorly-made browser that's being phased-out by 
      Microsoft in favor of a new one called Edge. However, it often still comes 
      installed on new computers. It's important not to use it, as it may open your 
      computer up to hackers.
    </p>

    <h3 id="browser-up-to-date">Keep your web browser up to date</h3>

    <p>
      Like the operating systems, most modern browsers stay up to date largely on 
      their own. In fact, Safari on your Mac or iPhone will get updated whenever you 
      update the system itself. Chrome and Firefox take slightly more effort on your
      part: when a new update is available, they simply need to be closed and opened
      again for it to take effect.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you're using Chrome and an update is available, an arrow like this will 
      appear in the corner:
    </p>

    <img src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.pcmag.com%2Fmedia%2Fimages%2F560136-how-to-update-chrome-on-desktop.jpg&f=1&nofb=1">

    <p>
      Simply click it, and then click the "Update Google Chrome" button. It will only
      take a couple of seconds.
    </p>

    <h2 id="other">Other advice</h2>

    <h3 id="installation">Be wary of what you install</h3>

    <p>
      Don't install any programs, browser extensions, or phone apps that you 
      don't 100% trust. Even things like mobile games can be viruses in 
      disguise. Even innocuous browser extensions can see everything on every 
      web page you visit.
    </p>
    
    <h3 id="links">Be wary of which links you click</h3>

    <p>
      Don't click any links - especially from unfamiliar emails or text 
      messages - that you don't 100% trust. Emails can be faked; the only thing 
      that can't be is a link's domain name (www.____.com, etc.). Make sure, if 
      you're sent a link by an unfamiliar email address, to hover over the link 
      and check that the domain name really does match the official website 
      for the company it claims to be from.
    </p>

    <h3 id="antivirus">You probably don't need antivirus software</h3>

    <p>
      If you follow the steps above - especially those in the "Computers and 
      phones" section - you probably don't need to buy an antivirus program. In
      fact, for reasons that are hard to explain, having one installed when 
      it's not needed can actually make you *more* vulnerable to hackers.
