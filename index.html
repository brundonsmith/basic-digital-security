    <h1>What is this?</h1>

    <p>
    There are a few basic things that every person with a computer, or phone, or 
    email account, should be doing to keep their digital lives secure from those 
    who would try and do them harm. This web page is a collection of these best
    practices, in plain English that any regular person can understand and follow.
    </p>

    <p>
    I recommend following this checklist yourself, and then passing it on to others!
    </p>

    <h2>Computers and phones</h2>

    <h3>Keep your operating system up to date</h3>

    <p>
    Whether on Windows, a Mac, an iPhone, a Samsung phone, an iPad, or anything 
    else, it's important to keep your operating system up to date at all times. All 
    of these systems should support automatic updates; in most cases, automatic 
    updates will be turned on for you by default. If they aren't, and you see a 
    prompt asking if you want to update, always say yes.
    </p>

    <p>
    If you're on Windows but don't have Windows 10, this update won't happen 
    automatically because it isn't free. But it's important that you perform it.
    If you **are** on Windows 10, your Start Menu will look something like this:
    </p>

    <p>
    Windows 7 and older have stopped receiving security updates. That means that 
    if a vulnerability is discovered that allows hackers into those Windows systems,
    it will not be fixed by Microsoft. This makes it a very bad idea to continue
    using these systems.
    </p>

    <h3>Use a secure web browser</h3>

    <p>
    Your web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari) is the program you use to 
    browse the internet. There are lots of nasty things on the internet, and one
    of the easiest and most important steps you can take to protect yourself from
    them is to use a secure web browser.
    </p>

    <p>
    These days, browser security is pretty good. The only really important browser
    *not* to use is Internet Explorer. It comes preinstalled on many Windows 
    computers. Its icon looks something like this:
    </p>

    <img src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fupload.wikimedia.org%2Fwikipedia%2Fcommons%2Fthumb%2F1%2F1b%2FInternet_Explorer_9_icon.svg%2F1024px-Internet_Explorer_9_icon.svg.png&f=1&nofb=1">

    <p>
    Internet Explorer is an old and poorly-made browser that's being phased-out by 
    Microsoft in favor of a new one called Edge. However, it often still comes 
    installed on new computers. It's important not to use it, as it may open your 
    computer up to hackers.
    </p>

    <h3>Keep your web browser up to date</h3>

    <p>
    Like the operating systems, most modern browsers stay up to date largely on 
    their own. In fact, Safari on your Mac or iPhone will get updated whenever you 
    update the system itself. Chrome and Firefox take slightly more effort on your
    part: when a new update is available, they simply need to be closed and opened
    again for it to take effect.
    </p>

    <p>
    If you're using Chrome and an update is available, an arrow like this will 
    appear in the corner:
    </p>

    <img src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.pcmag.com%2Fmedia%2Fimages%2F560136-how-to-update-chrome-on-desktop.jpg&f=1&nofb=1">

    <p>
    Simply click it, and then click the "Update Google Chrome" button. It will only
    take a couple of seconds.
    </p>

    <h2>Online Accounts</h2>

    - Avoid using things like real words and birthdays in your passwords. Even if you think they're sufficiently unpredictable, computers can test passwords by the millions per second. Your best bet is to use a totally random group of letters/numbers, and to not reuse it anywhere else. If passwords from one website leak, hackers will try to use those passwords on other sites, endangering your other accounts.
    - Set up "two-factor authentication" wherever it's offered on your online accounts. This will send a text message with a secret code to your phone whenever you try to log in from a new device, requiring you to enter it to sign in. This adds an extra layer of security.
    - Your email account is a sort of "skeleton key" for all your other accounts, since it can be used to rest your passwords. So the above two points are doubly important for your email account.

    <h2>Things not to do</h2>

    - Don't install any programs, browser extensions, or phone apps that you don't 100% trust. Even things like mobile games can be viruses in disguise. Even innocuous browser extensions can see everything on every web page you visit.
    - Don't click any links - especially from emails or text messages - that you don't 100% trust. Emails can be faked; the only thing that can't be is a link's domain name (www.____.com, etc.). Make sure, if you're sent a link by an unfamiliar email address, to hover over the link and make sure that the domain name really does match the official website for the company it claims to be from.

    <h2>Other</h2>

    - Personally, I don't use any antivirus software. The added protection it provides is arguably not necessary if you follow the above best-practices, and having it installed can actually make it easier in certain ways for your computer to be broken into. That said, there isn't universal consensus about whether the cons outweigh the pros.

  Malwarebytes appears to be reputable enough. However, these days the most important security practices don't require antivirus software; the value of it is debatable. It mostly removes bad stuff once it's already on your machine, but it's better to prevent things from getting there in the first place.

The most important security practices are:
- Always keep your operating system on both your laptop and phone up to date; apply updates immediately when available, and make them automatic if possible.
- Do the same for your web browsers.
- Use a secure web browser - you're best off with Firefox or Chrome. Edge and Safari are okay too as long as they're up to date. Don't use Internet Explorer if you can avoid it.
- If your laptop isn't on Windows 10, you should probably upgrade to it: older Windows versions have either stopped getting security updates or will stop soon.
- Don't install any programs, browser extensions, or phone apps that you don't 100% trust. Even things like mobile games can be viruses in disguise. Even innocuous browser extensions can see everything on every web page you visit.
- Don't click any links - especially from emails or text messages - that you don't 100% trust. Emails can be faked; the only thing that can't be is a link's domain name (www.____.com, etc.). Make sure, if you're sent a link by an unfamiliar email address, to hover over the link and make sure that the domain name really does match the official website for the company it claims to be from.
