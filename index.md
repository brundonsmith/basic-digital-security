# What is this?

There are a few basic things that every person with a computer, or phone, or 
email account, should be doing to keep their digital lives secure from those 
who would try and do them harm. This web page is a collection of these best
practices, in plain English that any regular person can understand and follow.

I recommend following this checklist yourself, and then passing it on to others!

## Computers and phones

### Keep your operating system up to date

Whether on Windows, a Mac, an iPhone, a Samsung phone, an iPad, or anything 
else, it's important to keep your operating system up to date at all times. All 
of these systems should support automatic updates; in most cases, automatic 
updates will be turned on for you by default. If they aren't, and you see a 
prompt asking if you want to update, always say yes.

If you're on Windows but don't have Windows 10, this update won't happen 
automatically because it isn't free. But it's important that you perform it.
If you **are** on Windows 10, your Start Menu will look something like this:

Windows 7 and older have stopped receiving security updates. That means that 
if a vulnerability is discovered that allows hackers into those Windows systems,
it will not be fixed by Microsoft. This makes it a very bad idea to continue
using these systems.

### Use a secure web browser

Your web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari) is the program you use to 
browse the internet. There are lots of nasty things on the internet, and one
of the easiest and most important steps you can take to protect yourself from
them is to use a secure web browser.

These days, browser security is pretty good. The only really important browser
*not* to use is Internet Explorer. It comes preinstalled on many Windows 
computers. Its icon looks something like this:

Internet Explorer is an old and poorly-made browser that's being phased-out by 
Microsoft in favor of a new one called Edge. However, it often still comes 
installed on new computers. It's important not to use it, as it may open your 
computer up to hackers.

### Keep your web browser up to date

Like the operating systems, most modern browsers stay up to date largely on 
their own. In fact, Safari on your Mac or iPhone will get updated whenever you 
update the system itself. Chrome and Firefox take slightly more effort on your
part: when a new update is available, they simply need to be closed and opened
again for it to take effect.

If you're using Chrome and an update is available, an arrow like this will 
appear in the corner:

Simply click it, and then click the "Update Google Chrome" button. It will only
take a couple of seconds.

## Online Accounts

- Avoid using things like real words and birthdays in your passwords. Even if you think they're sufficiently unpredictable, computers can test passwords by the millions per second. Your best bet is to use a totally random group of letters/numbers, and to not reuse it anywhere else. If passwords from one website leak, hackers will try to use those passwords on other sites, endangering your other accounts.
- Set up "two-factor authentication" wherever it's offered on your online accounts. This will send a text message with a secret code to your phone whenever you try to log in from a new device, requiring you to enter it to sign in. This adds an extra layer of security.
- Your email account is a sort of "skeleton key" for all your other accounts, since it can be used to rest your passwords. So the above two points are doubly important for your email account.

## Things not to do

- Don't install any programs, browser extensions, or phone apps that you don't 100% trust. Even things like mobile games can be viruses in disguise. Even innocuous browser extensions can see everything on every web page you visit.
- Don't click any links - especially from emails or text messages - that you don't 100% trust. Emails can be faked; the only thing that can't be is a link's domain name (www.____.com, etc.). Make sure, if you're sent a link by an unfamiliar email address, to hover over the link and make sure that the domain name really does match the official website for the company it claims to be from.

## Other

- Personally, I don't use any antivirus software. The added protection it provides is arguably not necessary if you follow the above best-practices, and having it installed can actually make it easier in certain ways for your computer to be broken into. That said, there isn't universal consensus about whether the cons outweigh the pros.
